### Hi there, I'm Claudio!
- I am a bilingual (Portuguese and English) Java Back-End Developer with a BSc in Civil Engineering and 3 years of experience in costs control under the construction industry. As a technology enthusiast, I love to use new tools to reduce time spent on daily tasks to improve time management and optimize data analysis and decision-making processes.
