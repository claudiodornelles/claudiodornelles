### Hi there, I'm Claudio!
- I am a bilingual (Portuguese and English) Java Back-End Developer with nearly 2 years of experience working with multiple technologies around the web development field. I also have a BSc in Civil Engineering and 3 years of experience in costs control under the construction industry. As a technology enthusiast, I have branched out to the technology field in 2021 in search for an opportunity to use the passion that I have to use new tools to reduce time spent on daily tasks to improve time management and optimize data analysis and decision-making.
